      <h2>How It Started</h2>
      <p>
        I woke up one day to see this beautiful creature staring serenely at me through my cottage door.  When I opened the door, she walked right in to the house and made herself at home,
        despite being hesitant to my other two indoor only rescue cats.  She ate and cuddled and went on her way, but I was already smitten.
        I thought she was a young neutered male, as I knew that an ear tip meant a cat was fixed, and because she was so sassy to the other outside cats - I was wrong!  She was just a smol
        young lady.  I immediately named her Bowie (after David Bowie) because she was a little star - and because the day she appeared
        just so happened to be his birthday (RIP).  
      </p>
      <p>
        I started calling on her every evening to eat dinner and stay the night inside, away from coyotes and other dangers.  She didn't love being confined, but she came
        back every single night.  I thought of it as a sweet little compromise - she could come and go as she pleased, and I respected her autonomy.
        I started talking to others in the neighborhood to find out more about her, but she was a recent addition to the area, it seemed.  No one knew who
        trapped her and took her in to PCC (Pet Community Center) to get "fixed".  Since I worked there at the time, I searched back through all the records - but it was hard to place her among the thousands of cats 
        that had come through, and record keeping on community cats isn't always the best.
      </p>
      <p>
        Our routine wore on for weeks, but then ... she didn't come home one night. I knew something was wrong. I posted on Next Door and checked in with neighbors, but
        no one had seen her recently. I was distraught all through the next day and prepared to accept the worst.  "I should have kept her inside" I thought. "I should have taken better care of her." 
        I was in no place to care for a third cat in a tiny home, but I loved her.  I sat on the porch all night, calling out her name, and after the sun set, I finally saw her!  
        She limped up the steps to my backyard, and I ran to pick her up.  She had a puncture wound on her leg - I had seen her valorously charge cats bigger that her multiple times,
        so I figured she had started the fight herself.  I admired her scrappiness, but this was a wake up call.  After an expensive vet visit, I knew I could either let her back out into the world of potential dangers,
        or I could make the decision to keep her safe and find her the home she deserved.  It was hard, and costly, but I chose the latter.
      </p>
      <h2>How It's Going</h2>
      <p>
       After months of acclimating to living with other cats (she never cuddled with my bonded pair, but they got close!) I managed to find her a home with a sweet older woman
        whose cat had passed away.  I was so thankful to find her a home where she could be the only cat and continue her safe life inside.  <br /> 
        <a href="https://aercmn.com/indoor-cats-vs-outdoor-cats/" target="_blank">Did you know that outdoor cats have a lifespan of only 2-5 years?</a>  < br/>
          Indoor cats have a much longer lifespan and can sometimes live to be over 20 years old!  So many people don't understand the importance of TNR (trap/neuter/return) and how keeping pet populations
        low ensures a better quality of life for all cats and the environments they share with other animals and humans.

        "Bowie's Friends" was created in Bowie's honor ‚Äî to fill a gap, help neighbors keep track
        of the cats we share our streets with and facilitate necessary care for them together.  I hope to one day grow this into an application with a much broader scope that caretakers in all communities
        can implement to help facilitate better care for cats the world over: better tracking, better record keeping, better communication, more foster and adoption opportunities for "friendly ferals"... the list goes on. 
        Like any good work, it is never truly over.
